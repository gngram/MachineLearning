# Linear regression

| **Estimated module length:** 70 minutes

This module introduces **linear regression** concepts.
| **Learning objectives:**
|
| - Explain a loss function and how it works.
| - Define and describe how gradient descent finds the optimal model parameters.
| - Describe how to tune hyperparameters to efficiently train a linear model.

[**Linear regression**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#linear-regression) is a statistical technique used to find the relationship between variables. In an ML context, linear regression finds the relationship between
[**features**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature) and a [**label**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label).

For example, suppose we want to predict a car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon based on how heavy the car is, and we have the following dataset:

| Pounds in 1000s (feature) | Miles per gallon (label) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3.5                       | 18                       |
| 3.69                      | 15                       |
| 3.44                      | 18                       |
| 3.43                      | 16                       |
| 4.34                      | 15                       |
| 4.42                      | 14                       |
| 2.37                      | 24                       |

If we plotted these points, we'd get the following graph:

**Figure 1**. Car heaviness (in pounds) versus miles per gallon rating. As a car gets heavier, its miles per gallon rating generally decreases.

We could create our own model by drawing a best fit line through the points:

**Figure 2**. A best fit line drawn through the data from the previous figure.

## Linear regression equation

In algebraic terms, the model would be defined as $ y = mx + b $, where

- $ y $ is miles per gallon---the value we want to predict.
- $ m $ is the slope of the line.
- $ x $ is pounds---our input value.
- $ b $ is the y-intercept.

In ML, we write the equation for a linear regression model as follows:  
$$ y' = b + w_1x_1 $$

where:

- $ y' $ is the predicted label---the output.
- $ b $ is the [**bias**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#bias-math-or-bias-term) of the model. Bias is the same concept as the y-intercept in the algebraic equation for a line. In ML, bias is sometimes referred to as $ w_0 $. Bias is a [**parameter**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#parameter) of the model and is calculated during training.
- $ w_1 $ is the [**weight**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#weight) of the feature. Weight is the same concept as the slope $ m $ in the algebraic equation for a line. Weight is a [**parameter**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#parameter) of the model and is calculated during training.
- $ x_1 $ is a [**feature**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature)---the input.

During training, the model calculates the weight and bias that produce the best model.

**Figure 3**. Mathematical representation of a linear model.

In our example, we'd calculate the weight and bias from the line we drew. The bias is 34 (where the line intersects the y-axis), and the weight is --4.6 (the slope of the line). The model would be defined as $ y' = 34 + (-4.6)(x_1) $, and
we could use it to make predictions. For instance, using this model, a 4,000-pound car would have a predicted fuel efficiency of 15.6 miles per gallon.

![Figure 4. Same graph as Figure 2, with the point (4, 15.6) highlighted.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/model-prediction.png)

**Figure 4**. Using the model, a 4,000-pound car has a predicted fuel efficiency of 15.6 miles per gallon.

### Models with multiple features

Although the example in this section uses only one eature---the heaviness of the car---a more sophisticated model might rely on multiple features, each having a separate weight ($ w_1 $, $ w_2 $, etc.). For example, a model that relies on five features would be written as follows:

$ y' = b + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4 + w_5x_5 $

For example, a model that predicts gas mileage could additionally use features such as the following:

- Engine displacement
- Acceleration
- Number of cylinders
- Horsepower

This model would be written as follows:

![Figure 5. Linear regression equation with five features.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/equation-multiple-features.png)

**Figure 5**. A model with five features to predict a car's miles per gallon rating.

By graphing a couple of these additional features, we can see that they also have a linear relationship to the label, miles per gallon:

![Figure 6. Displacement in cubic centimeters graphed against miles per gallon showing a negative linear relationship.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/displacement.png)

**Figure 6**. A car's displacement in cubic centimeters and its miles per gallon rating. As a car's engine gets bigger, its miles per gallon rating generally decreases.

![Figure 7. Acceleration from zero to sixty in seconds graphed against miles per gallon showing a positive linear relationship.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/acceleration.png)

**Figure 7**. A car's acceleration and its miles per gallon rating. As a car's acceleration takes longer, the miles per gallon rating generally increases.

### Exercise: Check your understanding

What parts of the linear regression equation are updated during training?  
The bias and weights During training, the model updates the bias and weights.  
The prediction Predictions are not updated during training.  
The feature values Feature values are part of the dataset, so they're not updated during training.
